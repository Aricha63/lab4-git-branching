# Lab 4: Git Basics and Branching

## Overview

This repo contains a simple "choose your own adventure" style Python story. You will create and explore multiple branches to simulate different versions of this story.

## Your Task

You will:
1. Create two new branches: `hero-path` and `villain-path`
2. Make different story twists in each branch
3. Commit and push all changes to GitHub
4. Write a short summary of each branch here

## Branch Summaries

- `main`: Original story starter
- `hero-path`: _[Describe your changes here]_
- `villain-path`: _[Added ability to accept or reject duel with squirrel. Accepting it leads to a great battle that ends with you taking the power of the nature spirit trapped within, strengthening your iron grip over the people of these lands. Rejecting it leads to him trying to fight you anyways, and in self-defense you absorb the spirit's corruption yourself and are overtaken by it. A 3rd option exists if you do anything else that results in an unceremonious end to the story.]_

## Final Checklist

- [ ] At least 3 branches (`main`, `hero-path`, `villain-path`)
- [ ] Each branch has its own unique story version
- [ ] At least 2 commits per branch
- [ ] Changes are pushed to GitHub from EC2 or local
